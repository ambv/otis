# currently unnamed softcut dual tape looper/delay thing

_very much a WIP, best to ignore_

---

there are two pages, _play_ and _edit_. navigate with encoder 1.

### _play_

* key 1 = ALT
* key 2 = flip L
* key 3 = flip R
* ALT + key 2 = skip L
* ALT + key 2 = skip R

* enc 2 = tape speed L
* enc 3 = tape speed R
* ALT + enc 2 = feedback L
* ALT + enc 3 = feedback R

_nb: skip behavior by default is "loop reset", however it can be configured to jump to random positions via the PARAMETERS menu._

### _edit_

* key 1 = ALT
* key 2 = rec on/off L
* key 3 rec on/off R
* ALT + key 2 = clear buffer L
* ALT + key 3 = clear buffer R

* enc 2 = tape length L
* enc 3 = tape length R
* ALT + enc 2 = panning L
* ALT + enc 3 = panning R
