# otis

stereo "tape" delay/looper thing.

---

there are two pages, _play_ and _edit_. navigate with encoder 1. hold key 1 for ALT.

### _play_

* key 2 = flip L
* key 3 = flip R
* ALT + key 2 = skip L
* ALT + key 2 = skip R

_nb: skip behavior by default is a loop reset, however it can be configured to jump to random positions via the ```PARAMETERS``` menu._

* enc 2 = tape speed L
* enc 3 = tape speed R
* ALT + enc 2 = feedback L
* ALT + enc 3 = feedback R

_nb: tape speed behavior by default is free, however it can be configured to be "quantized" to octaves via the ```PARMAETERS``` menu._


### _edit_

* key 2 = rec on/off L
* key 3 rec on/off R
* ALT + key 2 = clear buffer L
* ALT + key 3 = clear buffer R

* enc 2 = tape length L
* enc 3 = tape length R
* ALT + enc 2 = panning L
* ALT + enc 3 = panning R
