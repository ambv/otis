stereo "tape" delay/looper thing for norns 2.0

_very much a work in progress_

---

there are three pages, _mix_, _play_, and _edit_. navigate with encoder 1. hold key 1 for ALT.

### _mix_

* key 2 = mute L
* key 3 = mute R

* enc 2 = vol L
* enc 3 = vol R
* ALT + enc 2 = pan L
* ALT + enc 3 = pan R

### _play_

* key 2 = flip L
* key 3 = flip R
* ALT + key 2 = skip L
* ALT + key 2 = skip R

* enc 2 = tape speed L
* enc 3 = tape speed R
* ALT + enc 2 = feedback L
* ALT + enc 3 = feedback R

_nb: tape speed behavior by default is free; however, it can be quantized to octaves via the **edit** page._
_skip behavior by default is a loop reset; however, it can be configured to jump to random positions via the **edit** page._

### _edit_

* key 2 = rec L on/off
* key 3 rec R on/off
* ALT + key 2 = clear buffer L
* ALT + key 3 = clear buffer R

* enc 2 = tape length L
* enc 3 = tape length R
* ALT + enc 2 = skip config
* ALT + enc 3 = speed config
